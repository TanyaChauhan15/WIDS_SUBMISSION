# Week 5 — Speech-to-Text (STT) & Audio Intelligence

## Overview
This week marks the move into multimodal NLP, specifically focusing on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We dive into how raw audio signals are transformed into text using state-of-the-art audio Transformers.

---

## Concepts Covered
- Audio Fundamentals:
  - Sampling rates (16kHz standard)
  - Mel-Spectrograms and Feature Extraction
- STT Architectures:
  - Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)
  - OpenAI Whisper (Encoder-Decoder)
  - Wav2Vec 2.0 (Self-supervised learning)
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Word Error Rate (WER)
  - Character Error Rate (CER)

---

## Coding Tasks Implemented
- Preprocessing raw audio using Librosa and Torchaudio
- Fine-tuning a Whisper-Small model on Mozilla Common Voice
- Implementing a CTC-based decoding pipeline for Wav2Vec 2.0
- Evaluating performance using the Evaluate library
- Building a real-time audio-to-text inference function

---

## Mini-Project
**Multilingual Speech Recognition:**
- Evaluating Whisper's performance on diverse accents
- Baseline vs. Fine-tuned model WER comparison

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Librosa
- Torchaudio
- Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets
- Evaluate (Hugging Face)

---

## Key Learnings
- The importance of audio normalization and silence trimming
- How Transformers process 2D spectral data as sequence inputs
- Measuring transcription accuracy through deletions, insertions, and substitutions (WER)
