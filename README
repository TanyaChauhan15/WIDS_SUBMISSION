# WiDS 

This repository contains my complete work for the **WiDS (Winters in Data Science) NLP Track**.  
The journey progresses from **NLP fundamentals**, through **deep learning methods**, and finally to **modern transformer-based architectures**.

All implementations are done using **Google Colab** for easy reproducibility and accessibility.

---

## 📌 Overview of Weekly Progress

- **Week 1** focuses on understanding the basics of NLP and text preprocessing.
- **Week 2** introduces machine learning and deep learning techniques for NLP tasks.
- **Week 3** explores modern NLP using transformers and pretrained models.

Each week includes hands-on coding, experiments, and mini-projects aligned with the WiDS curriculum.
