# 🎙️ WiDS 5.0 — Speech to Text Engine

This repository presents my work completed as part of **WiDS (Winter in Data Science) 5.0**, under the project:

> **UID: 40 — Speech to Text Engine**

The repository documents **weekly progress, implementations, and learning outcomes** achieved throughout the program, covering the journey from **NLP fundamentals** to building a **complete Speech-to-Text (STT) system**.
