🎙️ WiDS 5.0 — Speech to Text Engine

This repository presents my work completed as part of WiDS (Winter in Data Science) 5.0, under the project:

UID: 40 — Speech to Text Engine

The repository documents weekly progress, implementations, and learning outcomes achieved throughout the program, covering the journey from NLP fundamentals to a complete Speech-to-Text (STT) system.
